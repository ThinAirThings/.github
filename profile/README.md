## What is Thin Air?
Thin Air eliminates the concept of “tabs” and “folders” on your computer. It introduces a new computer interface enabling you to have more screen space with no additional monitors, intuitively collaborate with others in an interface similar to Figma, and find anything you need without traversing through a nested set of files.


## What is this GitHub Page?
I began learning to code 4 years ago. Much of that has been in a silo. This is my attempt to share software ideas with others. [AirGraph](https://github.com/ThinAirThings/air-graph) and [AirPulumi](https://github.com/ThinAirThings/air-pulumi) are the most useful public libraries in here. [AirGraph](https://github.com/ThinAirThings/air-graph) is under very active development to power the Thin Air interface.
